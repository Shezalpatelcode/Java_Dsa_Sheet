Hey there viewers,
                This repository is a special curated question + code solution repo having placement related  50 questions and for sure if one (individual) is gonna sit for the interview and 
                his/her subject is DSA for sure you can practice these questions and related type of questions for the better response in the interview's wriiten or technical round .

                Thank you :)
